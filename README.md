==========

Realtime telemetry graphing library with unlimited recording (RAM limits..), smooth scrolling and unlimited
zoom-out without aliasing. Averages data hierarchically while recording and selects the correct level to
display according to current window size and zoom. It's like one-dimensional mipmapping and the whole dataset
takes only twice the memory of the original.
